         <p>Many people gain their programming education through <b>universities</b> and leave with a shiny piece of paper vouching for their skills. Despite what tradition may imply, college is not the right path for many developing programmers, and the industry knows it. <strong> Factors </strong>such as expenses, responsibilities, and other obstacles that appear in all of our lives can put college out of reach for some people. Add to that the recent explosion in online learners and resources, <b><i>and many hiring managers have recognized that college is not the end-all-be-all it is advertised as.</i></b>
