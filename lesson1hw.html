     <p>What exactly is a computer programmer? Computer programmers write code. They write code to design programs. This may sound vague, but computer programming is a vast field with many different specializations. In order to effectively include all of the database managers, web developers, systems analysts, and application devs, it is easier to group them under the umbrella of “computer programmers.”</p>

     <p>If you love writing code, computer programming might be for you. In this article we&#39ll discuss steps it takes to become a computer programmer. We&#39ll break down each step in detail so you&#39ll have a better understanding of what the work itself will look like. You may have seen some of our longer guides on finding a job in the tech industry like <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-full-stack-developer" target="_blank">How to become a full-stack developer</a> or <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/data-engineer-career" target="_blank">How to become a data engineer.</a> This article will cover similar steps to these guides, but we&#39ll dive a little deeper into the weeds of each one.</p>

     <p>Coders don&#39t necessarily have to be professionals to be considered computer programmers. There are plenty of hobbyists out there that, according to our definition of computer programming, make the grade. Even so, we&#39ll focus on the path to finding a computer programming career.</p>

     <h3><strong>Computer programmer vs software engineer</strong></h3>
     <img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/6476200228945920/image/download/4508013950140416" width="100px" height="100px">

     <p>To the uninitiated, computer science and software engineering describe two very similar disciplines. In reality, these two fields are completely different. Computer science is centered around learning general computational principles and applying them to a range of fields like machine learning, database management, and information security. Software engineering on the other hand is engineering oriented and revolves around the practical skills necessary to design, develop, and maintain software systems.
     </p>
     <p>Similarly, the role of a computer programmer and a software engineer are quite different. As previously mentioned, programmers typically work in a more specialized area of the development process. They are responsible for writing code and building software. Software engineers are still very much involved in the development process, but they are more likely to oversee broader areas as well. Software engineers are often responsible for conception of an idea, troubleshooting, and implementation as well as development.
     </p>
     <p> Coders and computer programmers occupy a unique position in the job market. It is common for large high-paying organizations to not require a computer programming degree or other bespoke education requirements. As long as you present the hiring team with a resume and portfolio of projects you&#39ve worked on, and are able to pass a technical interview, many companies don&#39t care if you <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-computer-programmer#requirements" target="_blank">don&#39t have a degree.</a></p>

     <h4><strong>What kind of programmer do you want to be?</strong></h4>
     <img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/6476200228945920/image/download/6657692645195776" width="100px" height="100px">
     
     <p>There are so many different flavors of programming that if you love to code, it may be daunting to determine what you want to pursue as a career. The best way to find out what you like to try as much as you can.
     </p>
     <p>Just a few types of programmer jobs to look into are:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Software application development</li>
        <li>Web development</li>
        <li>Front end, back-end, and full-stack</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-computer-programmer#requirements" target="_blank">Data science</a> and <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/machine-learning-for-data-science" target="_blank">machine learning</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/database-design-tutorial" target="_blank">Database administrator</a></li>
        <li>System design</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Each of these disciplines require slightly different skills. Seek out as much as you can with respect to all the different fields, and remember that nothing is set in stone. If, in your education, you find that web development is not what you find interesting and would prefer to spend your time training artificial intelligence and studying <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/neural-networks-python" target="_blank">neural networks</a>, allow yourself the the time to pivot. The world of computer programming is so diverse that it can be hard to find a niche, but it is very rewarding once you settle.</p>
